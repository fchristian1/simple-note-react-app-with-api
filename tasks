# note app with api

# idea
- simple note app with api to store notes
- notes should have title, body, date and category
- notes should be stored in a json file
- api should have routes to create, read, update and delete notes
- the react app should have a form to create notes and a list to display notes
- the list should have a filter to filter notes by category
